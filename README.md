# Phase 2 Project

Another module down--you're almost half way there!

![awesome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project-campus/master/halfway-there.gif)

All that remains in Phase 2 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a large project! This project should take 20 to 30 hours to complete.

## Project Overview

For this project, you will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.

It is up to you to decide what data from this dataset to use and how to use it. If you are feeling overwhelmed or behind, we recommend you ignore some or all of the following features:

* date
* view
* sqft_above
* sqft_basement
* yr_renovated
* zipcode
* lat
* long
* sqft_living15
* sqft_lot15

### Business Problem

We have had the house selling records for the last few years. With these data, I want to build a model in which I can use the features in the data about the house to predict the price. In this case, we can guide both the seller and buyer to their business. The seller can use the model to predict the selling price of their house and if they need to do any renovation before selling their home. The buyer can have some suggestions about which kind of house they can afford based on their budget. To the details goalï¼š

1. polish the data which have no meaning or is null to the price.
2. remove the features which do not contribute to the house price.
3. check if there are some high correlated features in which some of them can be removed.
4. build the linear regression model.
5. check how the features can contribute to the house change.

## Loading the Data
In the cell below, I load the house data into a dataframe and checked it's dimension and datatype.

df = pd.read_csv("data/kc_house_data.csv")
df.head()

I need to steply remove and polish most of the columns which is not contribute to the price of house
1. The id is not related to the price
2. Split the date file to month and year.
3. Since the lat and long data is high related to the zipcode, I need to remove them.
4. Remodle the zip column with only the first three number
5. Remove the sqft_living15 and sqft_lot15 from columns.
6. Change the yr_built to the age of house at sold time
7. Change the yr_renovated to if the house is renovated and is the renovated within 10 and 30 years at sold.

## remove the outlier data 
 I then drawed the distribution of each of the columns which had more than 10 unique value to check if there is any outlier values. There are multipal columns contain some outlier data. I then collected all the columns and remove them

 After remove the unnecessary data, in order to check the relationship between the price with most of the columns with few unique numbers, I plot their relations in seperate figures.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
